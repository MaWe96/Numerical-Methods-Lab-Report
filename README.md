The lab assignment consists of five exercises. 

They surround the following topics:
* Numerical Differentiation (methods: Second and Fourth order central difference formulas)
* Solving Nonlinear Algebraic Equation (methods: Bisection, Newton-Raphson, Secant)
* Interpolation and Curve fitting (methods: Newton interpolating polynomial, Least-squares line)
* Numerical Integration (methods: Trapezoidal, Simpson's rule)
* Numerical Solution of Differential Equations (methods: ODE-solver, 4th order Runge-Kutta)
 
In the lab report you must show all work and provide supporting arguments. 

Include all Matlab scripts in the report.
